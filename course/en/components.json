Public campaigns and requests for open data may also develop if you are a public agency or state institution.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that you publish as much open data as you can. Ask why a source of data should not be open, rather than looking for a reason to not open it. Consult with potential users on what data sources would be most useful to them if opened.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example</strong>: Many organisations have begun to publish open data to grow their businesses and to accelerate innovation, such as <a href=\"https://www.nestoria.co.uk/help/api-appgallery\" target=\"_blank\">Nestoria</a>, whose open data is used by developers of real&ndash;estate apps and services.

In other extreme cases, you might publish something unintentionally, such as commercially sensitive or personal data, which you then have to close.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This can undermine the strategic benefits of publishing open data and may contradict legal requirements. Potential users may not see you as a credible publisher and in turn avoid using your data and/or services.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Identification: </strong>Developers and users may recognise and discuss data shortcomings within the community, or someone may contact you directly to complain.

Ensure that you have sufficient resources to maintain the data sources that you choose to publish and that you keep to timetables for updating open data. Develop channels where consumers can report errors and endeavour to respond quickly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example:</strong> In the field of company open data, registers and gazettes, the community has celebrated the progressive publication of open data, while <a href=\"http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/the_state_of_open_corporate_data_wins_and_challenges_ahead\" target=\"_blank\">criticising governments such as Gibraltar and Tanzania who have recently closed sources of open data, and Spain which has resisted calls to publish open data from company registers.</a></p>",

If it is used extensively, and if they are a registered user, you could throttle their access to your open data - an extreme solution would be to permanently remove that organisation&rsquo;s access, or to completely &lsquo;close&rsquo; certain data sources. The best solution is to focus on continually improving your products and services, to stay ahead of your imitating competitor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example: </strong>Some markets can be more crowded and exposed to imitation risks than others. For example, a quick search of transport apps reveals a very crowded market with many similar and overlapping products. Some are more<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/06/the-best-transport-apps/\" target=\"_blank\"> unique and bespoke</a>, but many are not.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>",

You should seek legal advice, especially if they have copied trademarks and it is useful to keep a record of what material they have copied. You can also report the organisation to their website host and to search engines, to have them removed from search indexes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/08/fake-websites-esta-ehic-duping-travellers\" target=\"_blank\">Unscrupulous operators have setup copycat websites of the US entry visa system</a> and European&nbsp; health insurance cards (EHIC), duping unsuspecting travellers into paying unnecessary administration fees.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>",
